# Introduction
	This is a project that I worked on in my Software Engineering class in the fall of 2018. It is an implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe in Java and was created using the Gradle build tool. In this project, the professor instructed us students to use the model-view-controller technique. The professor included a few lines of code as a starting point and left the rest of the project to the students. The project consists of 3 classes: TicTacToe.java, TicTacToeModel.java, and TicTacToeView.java.
# The Program
	In the model-view-controller programming technique, the program is separated into three parts. The model contains the logic of the program and uses any classes or objects that are created. The view handles the output of the model to the screen or to a graphical user interface, or GUI. It also receives the user input. Connecting the two is the controller. The controller takes the model's logic and passes it onto the view. Similarly, the controller also takes the view's user input and gives it to the model for use.
	In the original version of this project, the users play the game in the command prompt. The first user places Xs, while the second user places Os. In the TicTacToeModel class, an enum called Mark is used to represent the marks on the board. The enum's values include X, O, and EMPTY. Similarly, an enum called Result is used to represent the winner of the game. These values include X, O, TIE, and NONE. Both enums include toString methods that are used by the view.
	The game board is a 2D array called grid consisting of Mark enums isntantiated with the EMPTY value. The size of the grid is specified in the TicTacToeModel constructor. Two important methods in the TicTacToeModel are the isValidSquare and isSquareMarked methods. The isValidSquare method receives two integers as input that represent the row and column of the square that is to be checked in the grid. If the specified square is within the bounds of the grid, then the method returns a true boolean. If it is not, it returns a false boolean. The isSquareMarked method also receives two integers as input and uses them to specify a location on the grid. If the value of the Mark in that location is neither X or O, then it returns a true boolean. If it is one of those values it returns a false boolean.
